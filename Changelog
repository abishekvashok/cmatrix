cmatrix-1.1b - 04/09/2000
- Added support for consolechars command as well as setfont.  Changes
  affect configure.in and cmatrix.c (main).
- cmatrix.c:
  main():
	- Changed optchr and keypress to ints.  Fixes endless loop
	  condition on Irix.		
  c_die():
	- New function, uses va_args to die with better info on the
	  screen.
- configure.in:
  - Rewrote tests for console and X window font directories.  Moved all
    font searches to end of the file so error messages could be more
    easily seen when running configure.
- Makefile.am:
  - Better information messages for installing X window fonts.

cmatrix-1.1a - 04/03/2000
- New autoconf support.  Probably a few things broken but it's a helluva
  lot better than the previous Makefile stuff.
- Updated email and web pages in documentation.
